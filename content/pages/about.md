I am originally from Wichita and recently moved to Austin! I am excited to find good spots for live music, outdoor activities, and craft beer. 

I believe in using the framework of intersectionality to solve the world's most important problems. I flourish when I am able to exercise my strengths in problem-solving, creativity, and empathy. 

Outside of work you can find me on the ultimate field. I've been an ultimate frisbee player and organizer for the last seven years. Ultimate has positively shaped how I approach equity, teamwork, leadership. I also love discovering new music (send me a playlist!) and cheering for the US men’s and women’s national soccer teams.

Reach out to me on Twitter [@jacobpfeiferco](http://twitter.com/jacobpfeiferco) where I share clips from design podcasts.
