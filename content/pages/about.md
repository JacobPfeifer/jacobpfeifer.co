I’m a multidisciplinary designer with a focus on research and information architecture. I’m passionate about disentangling ambiguity to create intuitive and accessible experiences. I’m interested in working in civic design and solving problems for vulnerable communities where user-centered design can often make drastic improvements in quality of life. 

I recently graduated from the Austin Center for Design where I’m earned a certificate in Interaction Design and Social Entrepreneurship. At AC4D, was we worked on wicked problems. I honed my skills design research, sense-making, ideation, story telling, usability testing, and interaction design. I take pride in being able to ask the right questions to get the most out of an idea, whether that be during user research, generative ideation, or design review. 

I believe design has incredible power. We create objects, spaces, tools, and experiences that shape the world. Everything we design, in return, designs us back. We are the result of the experiences we’ve had, the environments we move through, and products we use. I approach every project with inclusivity, compassion, and a focus on equity, hoping those values will eventually be reflected back into the world. 

I love technology and before settling on design, I dabbled python scripting, front end web development, and data visualization. I love to apply my technical background to collaborate closely with developers and lean into the handoff between design and engineering. 

Outside of work, you can probably find me throwing a frisbee. I have been an ultimate frisbee player and organizer for the last eight years and it’s had a huge influence on how I approach equity, teamwork, leadership. I also love discovering new music (send me what song you have on repeat) and cheering for the US men’s and women’s national soccer teams.
