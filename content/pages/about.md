I’m currently a student at the Austin Center for Design where I’m earning a certificate in Interaction Design and Social Entrepreneurship. At AC4D, I have grown my skills in-depth interviewing, sense-making, ideation, story telling, user testing, and rapid iteration. I’m excited apply all of the experience I’ve gained as full process designer, but plan to focus on a role in design research. 

I believe designers have incredible power. We create objects, spaces, tools, and experiences that shape the world. Everything we design, in return, designs us back. I approach every design challenge with inclusivity, compassion, and a focus on equity, knowing those values will be reflected by the people who use them. 

Outside of work, you can find me on the ultimate field. I have been an ultimate frisbee player and organizer for the last eight years and it’s had a huge influence on how I approach equity, teamwork, leadership. I also love discovering new music (send me the last song you saved to your library) and cheering for the US men’s and women’s national soccer teams.
