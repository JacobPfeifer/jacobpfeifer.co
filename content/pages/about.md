I care deeply about promoting equity and inclusivity through design. It matters to me that my work has a positive impact. I currently live in Wichita, Kansas and work in an unrelated field.

Community and sports are important to me. I've been active in ultimate frisbee as a player and community organizer for 5+ years, during which I a founded a non-profit, Wichita Ultimate. Ultimate has helped shaped my views on equity, teamwork, leadership.

Aside from design and ultimate, Iâ€™m an avid listener of indie pop and a huge fan of the US national soccer teams. 

Follow me on Twitter [@jacobpfeiferco](http://twitter.com/jacobpfeiferco) where I share clips from design podcasts.
