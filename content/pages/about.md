I’m currently a student at the Austin Center for Design where I’m earning a certificate in Interaction Design and Social Entrepreneurship. 

I believe designers have incredible power. We create objects, spaces, tools, and experiences that shape the world. Everything we design, in return, designs us back. I approach every design challenge with inclusivity, compassion, and a focus on equity, knowing those values will be reflected by the people who use them. 

I’m looking forward to growing my career in design research and interaction design after graduating this fall.

Outside of work, you can find me on the ultimate field. I have been an ultimate frisbee player and organizer for the last eight years and it’s had a huge influence on how I approach equity, teamwork, leadership. I also love discovering new music (send me the last song you saved to your library, pleae), trying new breweries around Austin, and cheering for the US men’s and women’s national soccer teams.
