I am originally from Wichita and recently moved to Austin! I am excited to find good spots for live music, outdoor activities, and craft beer. 

I believe that solving big problems requires designing with intentional intersectionality. I flourish when I am able to exercise my strengths in problem-solving, creativity, and empathy. 

Outside of work, you can find me on the ultimate field. 
I have been an ultimate frisbee player and organizer for the last seven years. Ultimate has positively shaped how I approach equity, teamwork, leadership. I also love discovering new music (send me a playlist!) and cheering for the US men's and women's national soccer teams.

Reach out to me on Twitter [@jacobpfeiferco](http://twitter.com/jacobpfeiferco) where I share clips from design podcasts.
