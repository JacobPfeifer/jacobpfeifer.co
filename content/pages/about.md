I am a UX designer driven by empathy and energized by learning from unique perspectives. I flourish when designing equitable solutions that focus on accessibility. I currently reside in Wichita Kansas and work in an unrelated field. I’m activly looking for work as a designer.

I've had a circuitous route to UX design. I’ve worked as a ski resort lift operator, track coach, landscaper, and courier. While I was struggling to find fulfilment in a career setting, I was able to fully invest my time and energy into ultimate frisbee. I've been active as a player and community organizer for 5+ years, during which I a founded a non-profit, Wichita Ultimate. Ultimate has shaped my views on equity, teamwork, leadership and it's safe to say I wouldn't be the same person without it.  

Aside from design and ultimate, I’m an avid listener of indie pop and care a little bit too much about the US national soccer teams.
