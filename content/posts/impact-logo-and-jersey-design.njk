<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Impact is an ultimate frisbee club team based out of Wichita, KS. I co-founded the team in 2015 and served as a captain until 2019. After a few years with our original logo, it was time for a visual refresh. 
    
<p class="font-medium">Goals
    <ul> Create a logo that:
        <li>better captured the team identity</li>
        <li>referenced something unique about our culture in Wichita</li>
        <li>was more adaptable in size, color, and layout</li>
    </ul>
</p>

{% set modal_alt = "Original Logo" %}
{% include "components/lightbox.njk" %} 

<p>As an aerospace manufacturing hub, Wichita earned the nicknamed the "Air Capital of the World". Additionally, the Kansas State motto is "Ad Astra Per Aspera" which translates: "To the Stars, Through Difficulty." This gave me the idea of a meteor <em>impacting</em> with the earth. Ultimately I decided to visualize the meteorite flying through the earth's atmosphere, trail behind it, impact imminent.</p>

<p>Iterating through designs I landed on a meteorite style I was happy with and a circle to contain it. With only the meteor in frame, it felt a little empty so I added stars. Fun fact: The four pointed star shape is call an astroid.</p>

{% set modal_img = "impact-iterate-1.png" %}
{% set modal_alt = "Iterating..." %}
{% include "components/lightbox.njk" %}

<p>A few tweaks later and we were almost finished. I'm not sure why I wanted to put the current year instead of the year we were founded. Thankfully, that and the Kansas state motto were left on the cutting room floor.</p>

{% set modal_img = "impact-iterate-2.png" %}
{% set modal_alt = "More Iterating..." %}
{% include "components/lightbox.njk" %}
<p>Here is the final set of logos!</p>

{% set modal_img = "impact-logo-2019.png" %}
{% set modal_alt = "Final Design" %}
{% include "components/lightbox.njk" %}

<p>I also designed our jerseys and other gear that that cycle and I'm super proud of how they turned out.</p>

{% set modal_img = "impact-gear-2019.png" %}
{% set modal_alt = "Jerseys, Shorts, Sun Hoodie, Reversible, and Hat" %}
{% include "components/lightbox.njk" %}

<p>Here they are in real life.</p>
