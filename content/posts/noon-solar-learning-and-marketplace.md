title: Noon - Solar Learning and Marketplace
date: 2022-08-25
summary: Conducted research with homeowners to understand how they learned about residential solar panels, from passive learning through installation. From there created product ideas and tested those concepts with users.

## Product and Vision Statement

Noon exists to elevate the benefits of solar to the mainstream while ensuring that homeonwers have all the information they need to feel decdide if solar is right for them. We aim to educate homeowners so that they can navigate getting quotes without confussion and get the best system for their needs. No one should have a poor solar experience.


Currently, homeonwers and bombarded with advertisments that oversell solar capabilities and mislead buyers on the impacts of the federal tax incentives. Door to door solar salespeople push them to install solar before they are ready, which leads to homeonwers who are unhappy with their system and solar installers who need to chase after and educate homeonwers before they are ready to purchase, leading to a high customer acquizition cost. 

## Exploratory Reserach

### Focus Statement
What have Central Texas homeowners learned in the process of transitioning to solar energy, and what were the gaps in their expectations versus the realities of their lived experience?

### Research Plan

My team designed an executed a research plan to gain insight from homeonwers who had already installed solar. The previous year, Texas encountered a nasty winter storm that led to the deaths of X and left millions of people without power for over a week. We thought folks in central Texas would bring a unique perspective as they thought about the adverse affects of climate change and how they might protect themselves from Texas’ un-reliable energy grid.  

 Our for our reserach were to understand:
- what motivated them to install solar
- how their finances and quality of life changed after installing solar
- the difference between their expectations before installing solar and the reality of living with panels on their roof - - if and - how their approach to sustainabiltiy has changed after installing solar

Based on secondary reserach, our foundational hypotheses were that: 
- People trust educational materials created by businesses that profit from shaping the consumer’s perception of the service/industry they serve.
- Gaps exist between the research people do before installing solar and the actual lived experience after solar is installed.

### Method #1: In depth interview
Our primary research method will be in-depth interviews.We hope that the in depth interview method will allow us to gain perspective on the experience of interviewees (from a mix of various participant types), and bring new insights on our specific questions around the various points of the process from a user researching and learning about to homes and communities with established solar panels.

### Activity #1: Facilitated journey map creation
Goal: 
To learn about the E2E process for transitioning to solar. To learn about the highs and lows of the process as well as the unexpected situations that may arise. 

Activity: 
Researchers will provide sticky notes and pen to the participants. 
Participants will be asked to list the steps taken in their solar journey from beginning to present. 
The researcher responsible for note taking taker write the steps listed . 
Participants will be asked to add the sticky notes to a piece of paper, in chronological orders. 
Participants will be asked to provide an overview of each step of the process. The highs and lows of their experience and what they learned each step of the way. 
After all the phases have been completed, participants will be asked: 
To rate their overall experience from the start to the end. 
What would they do differently if they had to go through the entire process again? 
The most important lesson learned from the experience. 

## Insights and Opportunities

### Insight 1 

Although people identify climate change as a key motivator for installing solar, they are ultimately pushed to action by personal incentives.

### Oportunity 1 
How might we position installing solar not just a social good but as a worthy personal investment?

### Insight 2
Evaluating the driving principles of an installation company is critical; failing to do so leaves people vulnerable an unfavorable experience.

### Oportunity 2 
How might we help people evaluate the driving principles of solar companies, to guide them to a more successful outcome?

### Insight 3
When people can visualize their energy consumption in real time it creates a feedback loop that empowers them to invest in energy efficiency.

### Oportunity 3 
How might we bring energy tracking to a wider audience, so everyone can learn about their energy consumption and adopt energy-efficient behaviors?
