<p>Impact is an ultimate frisbee club team out of Wichita, KS I co-founded in 2015. After a few years with our original logo, it was time for a visual refresh. Our first logo was pretty boring (I'm allowed to say this, I designed it) and lost detail in smaller sizes. I focused on creating a logo that better reflected our exciting team identity, was more adaptable both in format and size, and specifically referenced our locality.</p>

<p>As an aerospace manufacturing hub, Wichita is the "Air Capital of the World". Additionally, the Kansas State motto is "Ad Astra Per Aspera" which translates: "To the Stars, Through Difficulty." This gave me the idea of a meteor <em>impacting</em> with earth. Ultimately I decided to visualize the meteorite flying through earth's atmosphere, trail behind it, impact imminent.</p>
<p>Iterating through designs I landed on a meteorite style I was happy with and a circle to contain it. With only the meteor in frame, it felt a little empty so I added stars. Fun fact: The four pointed star shape is call an astroid.</p>

<p>A few tweaks later and we were almost finished. I'm not sure why I wanted to put the current year instead of the year we were founded. Thankfully, that and the Kansas state motto were left on the cutting room floor.</p>

<p>Here is the final set of logos!</p>

<p>I also designed our jerseys and other gear that that cycle and I'm super proud of how they turned out.</p>
